# 🌐 [warsztatykowalskie.pl](https://warsztatykowalskie.pl) – Informational Website for Kuźnia Billert

![Preview of the website](screenshot.png)


This is my **second commercial project** for **Kuźnia Billert**, a family-run company specializing in artistic blacksmithing.

## 🧩 About the Project

The website was created as a **replacement for a previous version** made using a website builder, which was inefficient and difficult to scale.  
The main goals were to:

- Reduce ongoing costs (by ditching the builder),
- Launch a fast and simple website quickly,
- Make it accessible on all devices,
- Clearly present the company’s services in a professional way.

🛠️ I developed the site in just **2 days** (+ a few follow-up corrections). It's not a perfect project — and it wasn’t supposed to be. Its main value lies in simplicity, speed, and clean presentation.

## 💬 Summary

This project marks another milestone in my journey as a web developer.  
It was also the **first project I built based on a visual mockup** — and I quickly learned how much smoother communication and revisions become when a mockup is involved.

With attention to detail (404 page, cookies, redirects, SEO, responsive layout), even a small site can look and feel professional.
